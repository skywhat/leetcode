// Hence, the frog is able to reach S2, and the next jump would be 0, 1 or 2 units.


// Then, we want to know if the frog can reach stone 3 (S3),
// we know the frog must be at either S1 or S2 before reaching S3,

// If the frog comes from S1, then 
// we know dist(S1->S3) = 3 - 0 = 3, and we know frog couldn't make a jump of size 3 at S1.
// So it is not possible the frog can jump from S1 to S3.

// If the frog comes from S2, then
// we know dist(S2->S3) = 3 - 1 = 2, and we know frog could make a jump of size 2 at S2.
// Hence, the frog is able to reach S3, and the next jump would be 1, 2 or 3 units.

// Sub-problem and state:
let dp(i) denote a set containing all next jump size at stone i

// Recurrence relation:
for any j < i,
dist = stones[i] - stones[j];
if dist is in dp(j):
    put dist - 1, dist, dist + 1 into dp(i). 

// Now lets make this approach more efficient.
// BECAUSE 
// 1. The number of stones is â‰¥ 2 and is < 1,100. 
// 2. The frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.
// 3. If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units,

// The maximum jump size the frog can make at each stone if possible is shown as followings: 
// stone:      0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
// jump size:  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (suppose frog made jump with size k + 1 at each stone)

// So instead of creating a HashSet for lookup for each stone, 
// we can create a boolean array with size of N + 1 (N is the number of stones),
// Like in the given example, at stone 2 the next jump could be 1, 2, 3, 
// we can use a bool array to represent this like
// index:    0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  ...
//          [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, ...]
// index is jump size, boolean value represents if the frog can make this jump.

// Then, the 2D array will be something like below.
